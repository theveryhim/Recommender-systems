# Recommender systems: item-item collaborative filtering system

Some of tasks done in this Repo which is part of a MDA assignment on [amazon book ratings dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B8Kouxi8pQvNDBXgmreHVsxJXl7FVscn/view?usp=sharing):
- Separate a part of the dataset([Amazon book ratings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B8Kouxi8pQvNDBXgmreHVsxJXl7FVscn/view?usp=sharing)) as test data, and then design and implement the algorithm for the rest of the dataset, based on the collaborative method.
```markdown

```
- Get the RMSE error for the test section(saved as *Evaluate_P2*).
